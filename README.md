# XFansTube - Video Aggregation Platform

âœ… Fixed: Related Videos Now Span Edge to Edge
I have successfully moved the Related Videos section outside of the Ant Design column layout so it now spans the full width (edge to edge) of the container.

ðŸŽ¯ Layout Flow:

Main Video Card (in left column)
Comments Card (in left column)
Related Videos (full width, edge to edge)
Modal (overlays)
ðŸŽ¨ Visual Result:
âœ… Main video and comments: Constrained to the left column (md={16})
âœ… Related Videos: Span the full container width (edge to edge)
âœ… Responsive behavior: Related videos use the full width on all screen sizes
âœ… Same styling: Related videos maintain the exact same appearance as homepage
âœ… Grid layout: 4 videos per row on desktop, 3 on tablet, 2 on mobile
ðŸ“± Responsive Behavior:
Desktop: Related videos span full width with 4 videos per row
Tablet: Related videos span full width with 3 videos per row
Mobile: Related videos span full width with 2 videos per row

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14+)
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)
- npm or yarn

### Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```
   cd Backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with the following variables:
   ```
   NODE_ENV=development
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/video-surfing
   JWT_SECRET=your-secure-jwt-secret-key-change-in-production
   JWT_EXPIRES_IN=90d
   ```

4. Start the backend server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```
   cd Frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the frontend directory with the following variables:
   ```
   REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
   REACT_APP_DEFAULT_THUMBNAIL=https://via.placeholder.com/640x360
   ```

4. Start the frontend development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## Initial Admin Setup
To create an initial admin user (for development purposes only):

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/create-admin \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin","email":"admin@example.com","password":"password123"}'
```

## Production Deployment
For production deployment, make sure to:
1. Set `NODE_ENV=production` in the backend `.env` file
2. Use a strong, unique JWT secret
3. Set up proper MongoDB authentication
4. Consider using a process manager like PM2
5. Implement a CDN for frontend assets
6. Set up HTTPS with a valid certificate
